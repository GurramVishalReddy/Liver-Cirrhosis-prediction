# Liver-Cirrhosis-prediction
This project focuses on early prediction of liver cirrhosis using machine learning techniques.
We applied models like Random Forest, LightGBM, and Voting Classifier on clinical and laboratory data.
The system aims to provide a non-invasive, accurate, and efficient solution for early diagnosis.
